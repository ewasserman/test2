There are two main concepts in the type-safe API: a TypedPipe[T] which is kind of a distributed list of objects of type T and a KeyedList[K,V] which represents some sharding of objects of key K and value V. There are two KeyedList objects: Grouped[K,V] and subclasses of CoGrouped. The former represents usual groupings, and the latter is used for cogroupings or joins.

Generally, all the methods from the Fields-based API Reference are present with the following exceptions:
1. The mapping functions always replace the input with the output. map and flatMap in the Type safe API are similar to the mapTo and flatMapTo functions (respectively) in the Fields-based API. 2. Due to the previous statement, there is no need to name fields.
